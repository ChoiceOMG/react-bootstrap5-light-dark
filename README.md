# Choice Branded Frontend
## React Bootstrap 5 (Light and Dark Mode) 

This will be a basic Bootstrap5 Sass design for light and dark mode React Apps

Add JWT and integrate with database (or strapi) for authentication.

This has SCSS for Bootstrap and will have choice brand colours (eventually).  Right now light/dark mode work.
The SCSS for Choice Brand colours will change.  Don't over-customize and keep coding as lean as possible.


## Key features

 - React Router
 - Dart SCSS
 - Helmet Async -> NEW version
 - Bootstrap 5
 - Choice Colourscheme <- Developing

Still working on functionality.  We may use this for everything from client applications, Choice staff applications, and pretty much everything else we can to standardize the look and feel of all our apps.
